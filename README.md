## 🚀 Challenge Statement

> *[Summarize the 1A prompt here]*  
> (For example: Build a system that extracts structured data from unstructured text-based forms.)

This project focuses on extracting meaningful structured outputs from raw, unformatted forms or textual content using modern parsing techniques and intelligent design logic.

## 🧠 Approach & Thought Process

1. *Input Analysis*  
   I started by analyzing the structure and irregularities of the given inputs to identify consistent anchors (like headers or numbering).
   
2. *Text Parsing*  
   Using techniques like regex, string tokenization, and hierarchy detection, I extracted only the title and discarded unrelated metadata.

3. *Clean JSON Output*  
   The final output ensures that:
   - Only the title is extracted from the input.
   - The outline remains an empty list as required.
